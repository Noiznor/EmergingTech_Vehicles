ðŸš€ Vehicle Image Classification using CIFAR-100 and CNN
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS).
We filter the CIFAR-100 dataset to focus only on specific vehicle classes, preprocess the data, train a deep CNN model, and visualize its performance.

ðŸ“‚ Workflow
Step 1: Load and Filter the Dataset

Load CIFAR-100 dataset from tensorflow_datasets.

Focus only on 5 vehicle categories:

8 â†’ bicycle

13 â†’ bus

48 â†’ motorcycle

58 â†’ pickup truck

90 â†’ train

Filter dataset to keep only these classes.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing and Pipeline

Map original CIFAR-100 labels to new labels (0â€“4).

Normalize images to [0, 1].

Build efficient TensorFlow pipelines:

Shuffle training data.

Batch size = 32.

Prefetch for performance.

Step 3: CNN Model Architecture

3 Convolutional Blocks with filters 32 â†’ 64 â†’ 128.

MaxPooling layers for downsampling.

Flatten layer to prepare for dense layers.

Dense layer with 128 neurons (ReLU).

Dropout (50%) to prevent overfitting.

Output layer with 5 neurons (softmax).

âœ… Compiled with:

Optimizer: Adam

Loss: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy

Metric: Accuracy

Step 4: Training

Train for 30 epochs (extended for better performance).

Track both training and validation accuracy/loss.

Step 5: Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model on test data.

Report final test accuracy and loss.

Step 6: Visualization

Plot Training vs. Validation Accuracy.

Plot Training vs. Validation Loss.

ðŸ“Š These plots help diagnose overfitting/underfitting.

âœ… Key Features
